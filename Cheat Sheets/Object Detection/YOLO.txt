Object Detection has an output of the form
[Pc    ==========> Probablility that there is a class present
 x     ==========> x co-ordinate of the Bounding box
 y     ==========> y co-ordinate of the Bounding box
 w     ==========> width of the Bounding box
 h     ==========> height of the Bounding box
 C1    ==========> Class 1 of the multi-class output
 C2    ==========> Class 2 of the multi-class output
 C3]   ==========> Class 3 of the multi-class output


YOLO 
For the YOLO architecture, entire imageis split into grid cells, for each cell, we'll check if it contains any object, and have 
a seperate output for that cell.

The correctness of the Bounding boxes is determined by Intersecion Over Union(correct if IOU>=.5)
